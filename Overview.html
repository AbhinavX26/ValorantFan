            <p align="justify">Valorant is a 5v5 shooter game made for fun purposes that drive the new kids wild today.
                It is a very detailed shooting game powered up with abilities that make the players sit on the edges
                of their seats as
                the attackers rush in to plant the spike and get radianite while the defenders guard the plant sites to
                prevent the spike
                from being planted. As the players use various abilities to get an advantage in a gunfight, in the end,
                what matters most is your skills with the guns. Without them, you're nothing in this world of miracles.
            </p><br>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="full-width-text">
        <p align="justify">Valorant's core is of course shooting, as it has a beautifully crafted system of guns
            that also have
            realistic recoil up to a large extent. However, the correct use of abilities, proper positioning, good
            communication and
            teamwork are equally important. No one can win Valorant alone. It's always a team game. So, you should
            never try going solo
            in this game - because it will always backfire, unless you're TenZ or something. So, find the right
            players to play with, and discover your style of playing the game. In the end, without individual skills,
            you'll
            just be a drag on your teammates.</p><br>
        <p align="justify">Valorant does have a limited arsenal, but there is a variety in the types,
            each weapon suiting a certain type of player. There are snipers which are used by players to eliminate
            threats from
            far away, there are rifles which are used by precise players that always go for headshots, there are small
            firearms which are used when your main gun runs out of bullets, there's submachine guns for mid-ranged
            efficient
            battles and finally, there are machine guns which can be used to absolutely destroy enemies standing in
            groups
            by spraying a ton of bullets into them. Combining them with the timely use of abilities is the key to stand
            on top.
